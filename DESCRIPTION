Description: Evaluate batch effect correction algorithms for scRNA-seq using multiple established methods, including the Adjusted Rand Index, 
    Normalized Mutual Information, Local Inverse Simpson Index, and Silhouette Width. Methods for aggregating and weighing multiple metrics 
    together are also included. For further explanation of methods, see Swamy et al. (2021)<doi:10.1101/2021.03.26.437190> .
